# SyriaTel Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

This project develops a comprehensive machine learning solution to predict customer churn for SyriaTel, a telecommunications company. By identifying customers who are likely to discontinue their service, the company can proactively implement retention strategies to reduce revenue loss and improve customer satisfaction.

## Business Problem

Customer churn is a critical challenge in the telecommunications industry, where acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones. SyriaTel needs to:

- **Identify at-risk customers** before they churn
- **Understand key factors** that drive customer churn
- **Implement targeted retention strategies** to reduce churn rates
- **Optimize resource allocation** for customer retention efforts

## Technical Objective

Develop a binary classification model that can accurately predict which customers are likely to churn based on their usage patterns, service history, and demographic information. The model should prioritize:

- **High recall** to catch most churning customers
- **Balanced precision** to avoid excessive false positives
- **Interpretability** to provide actionable business insights

## Dataset Description

The analysis uses telecommunications customer data containing:
- **Customer demographics** and account information
- **Service usage patterns** (calls, minutes, charges across different time periods)
- **Plan features** and service options
- **Customer service interactions**
- **Target variable**: Binary churn indicator (churned/not churned)

## Data Science Methodology

### 1. Data Understanding & Exploration
- **Initial Assessment**: Dataset structure, missing values, and basic statistics
- **Target Analysis**: Churn distribution and class imbalance evaluation
- **Feature Analysis**: Identification of numerical vs. categorical variables

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Correlation Analysis**: Understanding relationships between features
- **Distribution Analysis**: Examining feature distributions by churn status
- **Categorical Analysis**: Cross-tabulation of categorical features with churn
- **Pattern Discovery**: Identifying key indicators of customer churn

### 3. Feature Engineering
- **New Feature Creation**: 
  - Average call duration metrics
  - Total usage aggregations across time periods
  - Usage intensity indicators
- **Categorical Encoding**: Label encoding for categorical variables
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling data types and missing values

### 4. Feature Selection
- **Statistical Selection**: Using F-score to identify top predictive features
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Selecting the most relevant features for modeling
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Understanding which factors drive churn

### 5. Model Development & Evaluation
- **Multiple Algorithm Testing**:
  - Logistic Regression (with scaling)
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier
  - Decision Tree Classifier
- **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold stratified cross-validation for robust evaluation
- **Performance Metrics**: ROC-AUC, precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy

### 6. Model Optimization
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search optimization for the best performing model
- **Performance Comparison**: Evaluating improvements from tuning
- **Final Model Selection**: Choosing the optimal model configuration

### 7. Business Impact Analysis
- **Confusion Matrix Interpretation**: Understanding true/false positives and negatives
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Evaluating business impact of model predictions
- **Actionable Insights**: Translating model results into business recommendations

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Pipeline**: End-to-end data science workflow
- **Multiple Model Comparison**: Systematic evaluation of different algorithms
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Understanding key churn predictors
- **Business-Focused Metrics**: Emphasis on metrics relevant to business objectives
- **Visualization**: Clear charts and graphs for model interpretation
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Concrete steps for business implementation

## Model Performance

The final model achieves:
- **ROC-AUC Score**: Measures overall model discrimination ability
- **Precision**: Percentage of predicted churners who actually churn
- **Recall**: Percentage of actual churners correctly identified
- **F1-Score**: Balanced measure of precision and recall

*Specific performance metrics will be displayed upon running the complete pipeline.*

## Business Recommendations

Based on the model results, the following strategies are recommended:

### Immediate Actions
1. **Target High-Risk Customers**: Focus retention efforts on customers identified by the model
2. **Proactive Outreach**: Contact customers with high churn probability before they leave
3. **Personalized Offers**: Design retention campaigns based on key churn factors

### Long-term Strategy
1. **Monitor Key Metrics**: Track the most important features identified by the model
2. **Regular Model Updates**: Retrain the model monthly with new customer data
3. **Campaign Effectiveness**: Measure success of retention initiatives
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Iterate on model performance and business impact
